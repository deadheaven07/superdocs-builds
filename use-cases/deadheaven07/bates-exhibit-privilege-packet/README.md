# Bates Exhibit & Privilege Packet Builder

A production-grade legal e-discovery tool that ingests court filings and exhibits, applies deterministic Bates numbering, detects and redacts PII, marks privileges, and exports a reconciled exhibit packet with a tamper-evident manifest.

**I built this for the SuperDocs task.**

## Overview

Law firms and litigation-support teams produce exhibit packets for production and disclosure. A packet is a **Bates-stamped**, **privilege-logged**, **redacted** PDF bundle whose integrity can be independently verified from a manifest of SHA-256 hashes. This system makes the full workflow reproducible and auditable: from raw upload through to a final, PII-free, privilege-filtered PDF packet.

## Key Capabilities

- **Packet management** — create, rename, list, reorder, and delete exhibit packets.
- **Document ingestion** — accepts PDF, DOCX (via LibreOffice), scanned PDFs and images (via PDF images), with OCR fallback.
- **Bates numbering** — contiguous assignment per page, auto on upload, manual assign, and automatic re-stamping on reorder.
- **PII redaction** — detects SSNs, phone numbers, emails, names, account numbers (including alphanumeric `ACC-8821-4433`-style values) and medical terms.
- **Redaction workflow** — detect → propose → review/approve → apply → verify that redacted text is actually gone.
- **Privilege marking** — mark documents `privileged` / `not_privileged`, with reason/category, override, and a machine + human-readable privilege log.
- **AI review** — delegates to the SuperDocs API for drafting/review; sessions are reused per document and failures leave the document in a recoverable state.
- **Packet build** — cover sheets, stamps, exhibit-index PDF, privilege log, and a `manifest.json` with SHA-256 hashes for the final packet, every exhibit, and every source entry.
- **Validation & integrity** — validation pass before build; manifest SHAs are re-checked at build time.
- **Export** — final packet, per-exhibit PDFs, privilege log, and manifest for download.
- **Audit trail** — every significant lifecycle event (upload, processing, Bates, redaction, privilege, validate, build, AI) is recorded with metadata.
- **Reference-aware storage cleanup** — original/stamped/redacted files are deleted only when no document references them; uploads roll back on failure so no orphan files are left.

## Supported Formats

Accepts **DOCX**, **native PDFs**, **scanned PDFs**, and **image formats** (PNG, JPG, TIFF, WebP). Native PDFs and DOCX (via LibreOffice) are processed directly. Scanned PDFs and images are OCR'd via Tesseract to produce searchable PDFs with invisible text layers.

## Architecture

- **Backend:** FastAPI + SQLAlchemy (async, PostgreSQL), organized into API / services / domain / workers / storage / SuperDocs adapter layers. Alembic migrations under `backend/alembic`.
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, built with Vite, tested with Vitest, typed with `tsc`.
- **External:** PostgreSQL for relational state and audit; file storage for artifacts; the SuperDocs API for AI review (key kept server-side only).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architecture.

## Core Workflow

```
Upload → Validate → Process (OCR/text) → Bates assignment
    → Detect PII → Review/Approve → Apply redactions → Verify redaction
    → Privilege review → AI review (SuperDocs, session reuse)
    → Validate → Build (covers + stamps + index + privilege log + manifest)
    → Manifest/SHA verification → Export
```

## Getting Started

### Quick Start — Docker (Recommended)

One command runs everything — database, backend, and frontend:

```bash
cd bates-exhibit-privilege-packet
docker compose up --build
```

Or with a `.env` file:

```bash
cp .env.docker .env   # edit SUPERDOCS_API_KEY if needed
docker compose up --build
```

| Service    | URL                          | Description                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Frontend   | http://localhost:5173         | React SPA                      |
| Backend    | http://localhost:8000/docs    | FastAPI + OpenAPI docs         |
| PostgreSQL | localhost:5432               | Database (user: postgres/postgres) |

To stop: `docker compose down`
To wipe data: `docker compose down -v`

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16 (the `docker-compose.yml` starts one)
- **Recommended for full functionality:** LibreOffice (`libreoffice`) and Tesseract (`tesseract`) on `PATH`. Without them, DOCX conversion and OCR are disabled — document processing still works for text-based PDFs (see [Known Environment Requirements](#known-environment-requirements)).
- A SuperDocs API key (set `SUPERDOCS_API_KEY`).

### Backend (Manual)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env   # then fill in SECRET values
# start PostgreSQL (one terminal)
docker compose up -d
# start the API
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API is then available at `http://localhost:8000` (OpenAPI at `/docs`).

### Frontend (Manual)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev    # → http://localhost:5173
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` (backend). All secrets live only in `.env` (gitignored):

| Variable                                                     | Required        | Default                         | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SUPERDOCS_API_KEY`                                          | yes (AI review) | `your-key-here`                 | SuperDocs API key — server-side only, never sent to clients. |
| `SUPERDOCS_BASE_URL`                                         | no              | `https://api.superdocs.app`     | SuperDocs endpoint.                                          |
| `DATABASE_URL`                                               | yes             | —                               | PostgreSQL connection string.                                |
| `STORAGE_ROOT`                                               | no              | `./storage`                     | Root for original/processed/working/final files.             |
| `ORIGINALS_DIR`, `PROCESSED_DIR`, `WORKING_DIR`, `FINAL_DIR` | no              | `originals`, …                  | Subdirectory names.                                          |
| `TESSERACT_CMD`, `TESSERACT_LANG`                            | no              | `tesseract`, `eng`              | OCR configuration.                                           |
| `BATES_PREFIX`, `BATES_START_NUMBER`, `BATES_PADDING`        | no              | `CASE-`/`1`/`6`                 | Defaults.                                                    |
| `APP_HOST`, `APP_PORT`, `DEBUG`, `LOG_LEVEL`                 | no              | `0.0.0.0`/`8000`/`false`/`INFO` | Runtime.                                                     |

## Testing

Final verified numbers:

- Backend: `pytest -q` → **197 passed**, 6 warnings
- Frontend unit: `npx vitest run` → **7 passed**
- TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit` → **clean**
- Production build: `npm run build` → **succeeds**
- Live E2E: `python live_e2e_phase13.py` → **112/112 checks passed** against the running server + real SuperDocs

### Local test database

Tests run against `postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/bates_packet_test`. Start a test database:

```bash
docker run -d --name bates-pg-test \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=bates_packet_test \
  -p 5432:5432 postgres:16-alpine
```

## Security

- The SuperDocs API key is loaded from the server `.env` only and is **never** returned by any endpoint or exposed to the frontend.
- `.env`, `storage/`, `*.pdf`, `*.docx`, caches, and build output are gitignored.
- Upload validation checks MIME type and file content, and corrupt files are rejected before persistence.
- A failed upload rolls back all files (no orphan originals left on disk).
- `manifest.json` masks applied-redaction text (`matched_text` → `***`) so raw PII is not present in any delivered artifact.
- All final artifacts (final packet, covers, exhibit index, privilege log, exhibits, manifest) are scanned to be free of seeded PII.
- Privilege decisions validate the document belongs to the request's packet (UUID-to-UUID comparison), preventing cross-packet access.
- SuperDocs provider errors are translated to generic, controlled messages; raw provider bodies and keys are never surfaced.
- SHA-256 hashes in the manifest allow independent verification of exported packet integrity.

## Reliability / Idempotency

- **Redaction detection** is idempotent — repeated `detect` calls upsert candidates by identity and never duplicate, never delete approved/applied candidates.
- **Rebuilt packets** replace artifacts safely and re-verify manifest hashes.
- **Duplicate uploads** of identical content are rejected with `409`.
- **File deletion** is reference-aware — a shared source file is removed only when the last referencing document is deleted.
- **SuperDocs session reuse** — re-running analysis on a document reuses its existing session instead of re-uploading.
- **Failed AI analysis** reverts the document to `completed` so it is never stuck in `ai_analysis`.
- **Bates assignment is idempotent** — `assign_bates()` in `backend/app/services/bates_assignment.py` implements graceful re-entry:
  - No destructive wipe: existing assignments are never deleted; already-assigned pages are skipped.
  - `MAX(bates_number)` resume: computes `next_number = MAX(bates_number) + 1` (or falls back to `bates_start_number` on first run).
  - `assigned_pages` tracking: builds a set of `(document_id, page_number)` tuples for pages already assigned.
  - Page-level skip: when iterating documents/pages, any page whose key exists in `assigned_pages` is skipped entirely.
  - Document removal: if previously assigned documents no longer exist, all assignments are cleared and remaining documents are renumbered from `bates_start_number` to produce a contiguous sequence.
- **Result:** If the process is killed on page 45 of 100, pages 1–45 are already persisted with contiguous Bates numbers 1–45. On restart, the query returns `max_bates = 45`, `next_number = 46`, and the `assigned_pages` set contains pages 1–45. The loop skips them and resumes cleanly at page 46. No double-stamping, no gaps, no manual intervention.

## Resilience & Assumptions (Crash Recovery)

The **Bates stamping process is fully idempotent at the page level**. The `assign_bates()` function in `backend/app/services/bates_assignment.py` implements graceful re-entry:

1. **No destructive wipe** — the function no longer deletes existing assignments. Instead, it queries the `BatesAssignment` table for all existing rows for the packet.
2. **`MAX(bates_number)` resume** — it computes `next_number = MAX(bates_number) + 1` (or falls back to `packet.bates_start_number` on first run).
3. **`assigned_pages` tracking** — it builds a set of `(document_id, page_number)` tuples for pages already assigned.
4. **Page-level skip** — when iterating documents/pages, any page whose key exists in `assigned_pages` is skipped entirely.

**Result:** If the process is killed on page 45 of 100, pages 1–45 are already persisted with contiguous Bates numbers 1–45. On restart, the query returns `max_bates = 45`, `next_number = 46`, and the `assigned_pages` set contains pages 1–45. The loop skips them and resumes cleanly at page 46. No double-stamping, no gaps, no manual intervention.

## Known Environment Requirements

- **LibreOffice** (`libreoffice`): used to convert DOCX → PDF. If absent, DOCX uploads are marked `FAILED` with `"LibreOffice unavailable: cannot convert DOCX to PDF"` and are not processed further.
- **Tesseract** (`tesseract`): used for OCR of scanned-image PDFs and images. If absent, OCR is skipped and documents are processed from any extractable text layer.

Without both tools, the system still fully processes text-based PDF exhibits end to end.

## QA / Verification

A repeatable live end-to-end QA is provided at `backend/live_e2e_phase13.py`. It runs the full workflow against a running backend (with a real SuperDocs key), verifying upload, Bates, privilege (incl. the wrong-packet 404 regression), PII detection (incl. `ACC-8821-4433`-style accounts), idempotent re-detection, approve/apply, PII-free artifact generation, manifest SHA verification, idempotent rebuild, corrupt-upload orphan prevention, invalid-UUID 422s, real SuperDocs AI with session reuse, audit-trail completeness, and full storage/DB cleanup on packet deletion.

## Verification Status

| Check            | Status                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Backend tests    | **197 passed** (order-independent, forward + reverse verified) |
| Frontend tests   | 7 passed                  |
| TypeScript       | clean                     |
| Production build | succeeds                  |
| Live E2E         | 112/112 passed against running server + real SuperDocs |
| Security         | verified                  |
| Storage cleanup  | reference-aware           |
| Database cleanup | cascades + SET NULL audit |

**Final status: READY FOR PR** — Full backend suite (197/197) passes deterministically. Test order independence verified (forward alpha + reverse alpha). Individual file isolation also verified.
